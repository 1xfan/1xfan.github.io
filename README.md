## credits, months later
* I ([@1xfan](https://github.com/1xfan)), did the HTML and guided the project. I also did some of the CSS and bit of the JS!
* [@mangomochi7](https://github.com/mangomochi7) did a bunch of the CSS as well.
* [@ChrisMoc07](https://github.com/ChrisMoc07) and [@forcebro9](https://github.com/forcebro9) were there for moral support
