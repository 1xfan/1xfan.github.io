## credits, months later
* I ([@1xfan](https://github.com/1xfan)), did the HTML and guided the project. I also did some of the CSS and bit of the JS, and I was the photographer of Scout the Squirrel!
* [@mangomochi7](https://github.com/mangomochi7) did a bunch of the styling as well. Also helped with some of the ideas.
* [@forcebro9](https://github.com/forcebro9) coded the "Are you still there?" prompt and helped with other small JS components.
* [@ChrisMoc07](https://github.com/ChrisMoc07) inspired the original idea.
* And most importantly, *Scout the Squirrel* was there at CodeHS HQ and allowed their likeness to become the face of this project.
